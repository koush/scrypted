See below for additional recommendations.

## Port Forwarding
**Important Note**: Ports 10443 and 10444 are already being used by Scrypted itself. So, please choose a different port number, like 11443.

### What You'll Need
- Access to your router's settings (usually through a web browser).
- Ability to change settings on your host machine's firewall (like ufw for Linux or Windows Firewall for Windows).

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Port Configuration**
   - For simplicity, use the same port number (e.g 11443) for both "From Port" and "Forward Port" fields in the Scrypted Cloud plugin settings General tab.
   
2. **Access Your Router Settings**  
   - Open your web browser and go to your router's login page. You may need the router's IP address, username, and password.  
     > If you're not sure how to do this, [find the guide specific to your router here](https://portforward.com/router.htm).

3. **Navigate to Firewall or Port Forwarding Section**  
   - Once logged in, find the section that deals with "Firewall" or "Port Forwarding". It could be under tabs like "Advanced," "NAT," or "Security."
  
4. **Set Up Port Forwarding Rule**
   - Use the port number you chose in Step 1 (e.g 11443) to set up a new Port Forwarding rule on your router.

5. **Change Port Forwarding Mode in Scrypted**
   - Go back to Scrypted and navigate to the "General" tab in the Cloud plugin.
   - Select "Router Forward" from the "Port Forwarding Mode" dropdown menu.
  
6. **Test Your Setup**
   - In the Scrypted Cloud plugin settings, find and click the `Test Port Forward` button under the `Advanced` Settings tab. This will confirm if you've set everything up correctly.

7. **Save Your Settings**
   - Don't forget to save your changes in both your router and in Scrypted.

### Firewall Configuration
Make sure your host machineâ€™s firewall isn't blocking the port you've chosen. You may need to create an 'allow' rule for this port in your host's firewall settings.

## Custom Domains

Custom Domains can be used with the Cloud Plugin.

Set up a reverse proxy to the https Forward Port shown in settings.


## Cloudflare Tunnels

Scrypted Cloud automatically creates a login free tunnel for remote access.

The following steps are only necessary if you want to associate the tunnel with your existing Cloudflare account to manage it remotely.

1. Create the Tunnel in the [Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Copy the token shown for the tunnel shown in the `install [token]` command. For example, if you see `cloudflared service install eyJhI344aA...`, then `eyJhI344aA...` is the token you need to copy.
3. Paste the token into the Cloud Plugin Advanced Settings.
4. Add a `Public Hostname` to the tunnel.
    * Choose a (sub)domain.
    * Service `Type` is `HTTPS` and `URL` is `localhost:port`. Replace the port with `Forward Port` from Cloud Plugin Settings.
    * Expand `Additional Application Settings` -> `TLS` menus and enable `No TLS Verify`.

5. Reload Cloud Plugin.
6. Verify Cloudflare successfully connected by observing the `Console` Logs.
