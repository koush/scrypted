We want to ensure that `HAP-NodeJS` is secure for everyone. If you've discovered a security vulnerability,
we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a [responsible manner][link-responsible-disclosure].

Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put the entire community at risk. If you've discovered a security concern,
please email us at [mail@anderl-bauer.de](mailto:mail@anderl-bauer.de) with [SECURITY] in the subject line.
We'll work with you to make sure we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address your concern.
We consider correspondence sent to this email address our highest priority,
and work to address any issues that arise as quickly as possible.

After a security vulnerability has been corrected, a security hotfix release will be deployed as soon as possible.
