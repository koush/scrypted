# Arlo Plugin for Scrypted

The Arlo Plugin connects Scrypted to Arlo cloud, allowing you to access all of your Arlo cameras in Scrypted.

It is highly recommended to create a dedicated Arlo account for use with this plugin and share your cameras from your main account, as Arlo only permits one connection to their servers per account. Using a separate account allows you to use the Arlo app or website simultaneously with this plugin.

The account you use for this plugin must have either SMS or email set as the default 2FA option. Once you enter your username and password on the plugin settings page, you should receive a 2FA code through your default 2FA option. Enter that code into the provided box, and your cameras will appear in Scrypted. Or, see below for configuring IMAP to auto-login with 2FA.

If you experience any trouble logging in, clear the username and password boxes, reload the plugin, and try again.

## IMAP 2FA

The Arlo Plugin supports using the IMAP protocol to check an email mailbox for Arlo 2FA codes. This requires you to specify an email 2FA option as the default in your Arlo account settings.

The plugin should work with any mailbox that supports IMAP, but so far has been tested with Gmail. To configure a Gmail mailbox, see [here](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?hl=en) to see the Gmail IMAP settings, and [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) to create an App Password. Enter the App Password in place of your normal Gmail password.
