# Sample Scrypted Plugin

1. npm install
2. Open this plugin directory in VS Code.
3. Edit `.vscode/settings.json` to point to the IP address of your Scrypted server. The default is `127.0.0.1`, your local machine. Also choose the appropriate debug target paths for remote debug source mapping.
4. Press Launch (green arrow button in the Run and Debug sidebar) to start debugging.
  * The VS Code `Terminal` area may show an authentication failure and prompt you to log in to the Scrypted Management Console with `npx scrypted login`. You will only need to do this once. You can then relaunch afterwards.
