# TensorFlow Object Detection for Scrypted

This plugin adds object detection capabilities to any camera in Scrypted. Having a fast GPU and CPU is highly recommended.

The TensorFlow Plugin should only be used if you are a Scrypted NVR user. It will provide no benefits to HomeKit, which does its own detection processing.

## Platform Support

  * Edge TPU (Coral.ai) hardware acceleration is NOT supported by this plugin, install TensorFlow-Lite instead.
  * Mac users should install CoreML Plugin for hardware acceleration.
