# Binary Sensor Interface

This device serves as a companion for the Hikvision Doorbell device. It provides a binary sensor interface for monitoring the door opening state, which is integrated into models such as the DS-KV6113.

The Binary Sensor monitors the door opening state and reports:
- **Closed** (binaryState: false) - Door is closed
- **Open** (binaryState: true) - Door is open

This sensor provides a simple binary state indication that can be used for automation and monitoring purposes.
