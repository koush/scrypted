# Twilio SendGrid Plugin for Scrypted

The Twilio SendGrid Plugin allows you to send Scrypted notification as emails, using the SendGrid API. If a media resource is included in the Scrypted notification settings, this plugin will convert it to an image and add it to the email as an attachment.

Using this plugin requires a SendGrid account, a SendGrid API key, and a verified email address to use as the email sender field. For more information on getting a SendGrid account created and set up, see https://sendgrid.com/.
