# OpenVINO Object Detection for Scrypted

This plugin adds object detection capabilities to any camera in Scrypted. Having a fast GPU and CPU is highly recommended.

The OpenVINO Plugin should only be used if you are a Scrypted NVR user. It will provide no
benefits to HomeKit, which does its own detection processing.
